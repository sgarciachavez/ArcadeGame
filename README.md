# Classic Arcade Game - Frogger

An Arcade Game - Frogger created as a project required by Udactiy. 

## Instructions

The object of the game to get your player / sprite across the wall.  Starting from the grass area moving over the wall to the water area without crashing into any bugs.  If the player is hit by a bug, the player is moved back to the starting position in the grass area.  

To move the sprite use the arrow keys: 
- up arrow key to move forward
- down arrow key to move backwards
- right arrow key to move to the right
- left arrow key to move to the left

The scoreboard will keep track of the number of moves made and also the number of crashes.  

Once the sprite gets over the wall without getting hit, the player is displayed a pop-up window congratulating the user.  The user then has the option of closing the pop-up and/or playing again. At which point the player is moved back to the starting position and the scoreboard is set to zeros.  The player also has the option of reseting the game anytime he/she wishes.
